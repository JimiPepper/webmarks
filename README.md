WEBMARKS
========

## DESCRIPTION

It is a simple desktop app using `nw.js` which I program for my own needs.
The purpose will be to bring back all my web bookmarks i saved across all my browsers in only one place.
This piece of software uses mainly __Javascript__, __HTML5__ and __Web SQL Database__ as IS engine.

Currently, Webmarks embed a simple information system composed of tables :

+ Bookmarks
+ Tags

For more details, please take a look at `db.sql` in _resources_ folder.

## PLANNING

The list below gathers all features that I will implement as soon I can :

+ Add a tag system : Assign one or more tags for any saved bookmark
+ Set up a search bar with a simple query language (or not I am not sure yet)
+ Edit a bookmark in a dedicated panel (with, of course, an option to delete it)
+ Build a better UI (I imagine with Bootstrap to make this step easier and quicker)
+ Export and load webmark's database (I may use JSON format, I have to think more before to choose definitely because It will depends a lot on the database's size)
+ Synchronize automatically Webmarks with web browsers to add itself new bookmarks saved without doing it by ourselves

## CONTRIBUTION

If you like the idea and want to help me by implementing a feature listed above or by bringing a fix, feel free to make a pull-request or create an issue. The only risk you will take is to make me happier and more motivated :D From a law perspective (and more seriously), Webmarks is open-source and the source code is under the GPL licence.
